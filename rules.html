              There's gonna be a couple ground rules.</i><br></div>

            <div class="line">
              <b>>>Google is your friend. The admins are not.<br><br></b>
              <b>>>Everything is case-sensitive. Answers to all questions, passwords to all encrypted files and key of all ciphers used are lowercase and without any space between words.</b><br>
              For e.x., answer to a question is "<b>We won, Mr. Stark.</b>"<br> Then the answer to be used is <b>wewonmrstark</b><br>
              <b><i>Also, keep in mind: all the links are also case-sensitive.</b></i><br><br>
              <b>>></b>This is a full-blown treasure hunt! Yeah like those Dan Brown novels and the Nicholas Nage movies. No seperate questions. Just one long hunt.<br><br>
              <b>>></b>Sounds pretty easy right? Hmm, who am I to say otherwise. So, in a nutshell, it is a treasure hunt. But, what's the fun in that! So, for your pleasure, or torment, the hunt is in the style of Cicada 3301. Oooohhh noice! Anything is interconnected to everything, or nothing. Wait, I'm confusing myself. Anyway, so a hunt, one thing leads you to another, until you reach The Finish Line. No answer is straight away that easy, you will have to work hard in order to figure out your way around it. You'll understand this in due time.<br><br>
              <b>>>Ru1e_0ne</b> The Crypto-Hunt will be a 48 Hours Event; starting from 12 a.m. on 11 May, 2021 to 11:59 p.m. on 12 May, 2021. Results will be declared on 13 May, 2021.<br><br>

<b>>>Rul3_Tw0</b> Everyone for themselves. This is The Hunger Games, except for all the cheesy teen stuff.<br><br>

<b>>>Ru1e_Thr33</b> It is preferred that The Player has access to a PC and an Internet connection at all times. Although, it can be played on Android.<br><br>
<b>>>Ru1e_F0ur</b> In the end, The First Player who finishes the Hunt will be deemed as the Winner. The Winner will be decided, upon the time stamp on which they reached the The Finish Line. */In case of any other error during the Final Round or a tie in the results, The Hunt Master will organise a Tiebreaker within the next 1 Hour.<br><br>

<b>>>Ru1e_F1v3</b> If nobody reaches the end in the required time limit, The Hunt Master will take the Levels cleared into account, during judgement of the Winner of the Hunt.<br><br>

<b>>>Rul3_5ix</b> The Hints for the levels and major announcements will be shared on the <a href="https://chat.whatsapp.com/HPoWExyvXT7010QAY5oDSZ">The WhatsApp Group</a>.<br><br>

<b>>>Ru1e_5ev3n</b> Alliance formation among different Players is not against the rules but generally frowned upon. */Did you understand that <a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nGMrD.gif">reference</a> :)? But There is a catch;<br><br>

<b>>>Rul3_E1ght</b> There is a bounty system established, though. If a player is found cheating, providing answers to a question to another player, with sufficient evidence, then that player will be disqualified.<br><br>

<b>>>Rul3_N1ne The Admin will be confirming leads. But not all the time and not all of them. */And obviously not any idiotic questions. He will also not be always online for lead confirmations.</b><br><br>

<b>>>Ru1e_T3n Hints will be provided only on the WhatsApp group and only for those questions, which we think are too difficult for majority of the players to decrypt. No hints will be given personally, so don't bother anyway.</b><br><br>

<b>>>Rul3_El3v3n If there is any spamming, fooling-around or unnecessary chats and/or calls on the Mobile Number or WhatsApp on behalf of a Player, there will be an obvious penalty and immediate block, which may also lead upto Disqualification.</b>
